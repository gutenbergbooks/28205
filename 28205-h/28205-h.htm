<h3><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>

<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word (<i>in</i>) means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while (<i>off</i>) indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
(<i>off, coming in</i>) are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words (<i>mob</i>) or (<i>crowd
noise</i>) you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>We take pleasure in presenting this story of Washington
crossing the Delaware. The picture of that famous event
is familiar to everyone, but the story of what led up to it,
and of its importance in American history is not so well
known.</p>

<p>The fall and early winter of the year 1776 saw the fortunes
of Washington's army sink very low indeed. Beginning
with the defeat on Long Island in late August, Washington
and his army had met reverse after reverse. They had been
forced to retire in succession from Manhattan to Fort
Washington, then across the river to Fort Lee, then from
Fort Lee to Hackensack. This succession of defeats and
the enforced retirements had disorganized and depleted
the army. But even worse than that, it had well-nigh
ruined the morale of the civilian population, whose hearty
support was absolutely necessary if the war was to be carried
on. But now, discouraged and disheartened, the mass
of the population gave Washington no help, no encouragement,
no cooperation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the situation on the morning of November 22,
1776, as we begin our story. Washington is in his headquarters
at Hackensack, New Jersey, when Colonel Joseph
Reed, his aide, enters&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Good morning, General Washington!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good morning, Colonel, what news?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Not much, I'm afraid, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Have we no information of the British movements yet?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>None!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>What's the matter with our intelligence service?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>It's completely disrupted, sir; and we can get no help from
the civilian population.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I know&mdash;they've lost all faith in us, Colonel. Nothing
but a victory can bring us again the loyalty and help of
our own people! It's discouraging, Colonel, to think that
now when we need it more than ever before, we can get
no help!</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Sir, if we could only turn and strike a quick blow, we might
recapture Fort Lee.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;if I only knew what force of the enemy is holding
the Fort, and when Lord Howe expects to bring the rest
of his army across the Hudson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Well, we don't know that!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>And without an intelligence service we can't find out! Of
course if General Lee would join me&mdash;there wasn't any
word from Lee this morning, was there?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>None, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Oh, why doesn't he answer? Why doesn't he come? It's
been more than a week now since I ordered him to join me
at once! Have you heard any rumor about him? Has he
left Peekskill yet? Has he crossed the Hudson?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>I haven't heard a word. He hasn't even acknowledged the
last half dozen orders I've forwarded to him.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>That's the most discouraging thing of all! If the second
in command won't obey orders, is it any wonder that the
rest of the army is out of hand? Oh, well! We can't hope
to do anything without Lee's help, so there's nothing for
us to do but retreat&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Again?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes, Colonel, our small force is uselessly exposed here. We
can't risk capture&mdash;that would be the end of everything!</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>If Lord Howe crosses the Hudson in force, we'd be
trapped between the Hackensack and the Passaic Rivers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>I'm afraid so, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>So&mdash;we've got to begin our retreat at once.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>The troops are ready to move, sir. It shouldn't take us
long to get out of danger with our small force.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes, yes, that's one advantage of a small army, isn't it,
Colonel? At least we can retreat rapidly! I suppose the
force we have is even smaller today than it was yesterday?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>I'm afraid so, sir. The morning report showed less than
five thousand present and fit for duty!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>If we only had Lee's seven thousand! But we haven't.
You may order the retreat at once, Colonel.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes sir, over what route?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>We'll move across the Acquackonack bridge, and thence
to Newark.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, sir. I'll write the orders, sir. (<i>rattle of paper</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Colonel John Glover with his Marblehead regiment will
cover the retreat as usual.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, sir. And the advance?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Knox and his artillery will lead. We mustn't lose our
guns&mdash;the few we have left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON (<i>half to himself</i>)</p>

<p>Retreat&mdash;retreat&mdash;retreat! Is there nothing else in
store for us?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Will you sign these, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the quill.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Here you are, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Thank you. (<i>rattle of paper</i>) You may send the orders
at once, Colonel.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, General. (<i>calling</i>) Orderly!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Deliver these orders at once!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I suppose it's useless to send another order to Lee.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>We can send one&mdash;I don't think it will have any effect.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>He ought to be informed of where we're going&mdash;yes,
write him again, tell him we're retreating to Newark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Very well, sir&mdash;and after Newark?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Retreat again I suppose. New Brunswick&mdash;Trenton&mdash;across
the Delaware into Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes sir, if we have any army left by then.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>We have some loyal souls who will stand with us to the
end. We may have to retreat to the back country of
Pennsylvania; but winter is coming, Lord Howe is not
an energetic foe, and he will hardly press us after the
snow falls. Then if we can fill up our depleted ranks
we'll be ready for him in the spring.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Oh, General, if we could only make one stand against the
enemy! Make one bold stroke to put new heart into our
discouraged countrymen!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I know&mdash;I know, Colonel! If Lee would only obey my
orders!</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Very little hope of that!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I know&mdash;and I can't understand his motives!</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Why sir, they're perfectly plain to me&mdash;and to the rest
of the army.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Indeed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Certainly&mdash;he wants to discredit you&mdash;to bring about
your failure&mdash;so that he can succeed to your command!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>So&mdash;? (<i>pause</i>) Well, if Lee can bring victory where I
have failed, I'll be only too glad to step down in his favor.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Sir, I beg of you, you mustn't even entertain such a
thought, why General Lee could no more&mdash;(<i>knock</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Will you see who it is, Colonel.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, sir&mdash;(<i>mumble at a distance, then out loud</i>) General,
there's a man here who wants to see you.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Who is it?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>He refuses to give his name, and says his business is
private.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Tell him to come in.</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Yes, sir&mdash;(<i>off</i>) Come on in, the General will see you.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Thankee&mdash;thankee, sir. I'm obleeged to ye, sir. (<i>in</i>)
Be ye General Washington?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I am, and what can I do for you?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal'&mdash;General&mdash;if ye don't mind&mdash;er&mdash;er<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I'd like to see ye alone&mdash;sir&mdash;it's important!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Alone? Oh, very well, Colonel&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>I'll go, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Write that letter to Lee.</p>

<p class="center">REED (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, sir. (<i>door closes</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Now, what is it?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal', here I be, General&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>An' I've had tarnation's own time gittin' here&mdash;I cal'ate
half yer army stopped me an' wanted to know my name
an' my business&mdash;an' they wasn't goin' to let me in when
I wouldn't tell 'em. But it takes more'n that to stop John
Honeyman when he gits sot on doin' something.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Your name is John Honeyman?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>That's me, sir, an' I promised Marthy&mdash;that's my wife,
sir&mdash;that I'd come to see ye&mdash;and I come, an' here I be!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>And what can I do for you, Mr. Honeyman?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Nary a thing, General Washington.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Then what&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I come to make ye an offer.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I'm in a way to find out a lot o' things that's goin' on in
the British Army.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>So?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Aye, ye see, I'm a butcher.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>An' I've got a contract to supply the redcoats with beef.
Now they think I'm a good Tory! But General, I ain't!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I'm glad to hear that!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>An' I figgered that mebbe I could find out things an' tell
ye about 'em&mdash;if we could fix things up.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>How much do you want for your information?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>No! No! General! I ain't tryin' to sell ye nothin'!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Honeyman. But I have so many
insincere offers.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I know&mdash;I know! I hear folks talk. They think I'm a
Tory! Wal', sir, I want they should keep on a-thinkin'
it! I cal'ate if I'm a-goin' to be any use to ye, nobody must
know I ain't a rip-roarin' all-fired Tory.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Certainly!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>An' that's the why I wouldn't tell none o' yer men what
my name er my business was.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Mr. Honeyman, you've shown extraordinary good sense!
You're exactly the man I've been looking for! I'm in
desperate need of reliable information. And I believe
you're the man to get it for me.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I cal'ate I be.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Have you any information now?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>A mite.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis is bringin' 15,000 men across the Hudson
tonight, to git ye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>We'll be gone.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>That's fu'st-rate! Now I'll be goin'&mdash;an' I'll keep ye
informed when I know anything ye ought to know.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Just a moment, Honeyman. How are you going to get
your information to me?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal', I figger I might come to see ye&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>No, you'd be sure to excite suspicion.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I'd be as keerful as could be.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>No&mdash;I mustn't even let my own men know you're
working for me.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal'&mdash;ye might have me captured now an' agin&mdash;tell
yer men I'm a notorious Tory&mdash;an' have 'em be on the
lookout fer me particular! Then when I've got something
fer ye, I'll put myself in the way o' gittin' captured.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good! That's an excellent idea. I'll have to give you a
pretty bad name with my troops.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Pshaw&mdash;I don't mind that, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>And I don't know how I can reward you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I don't need no reward to help ye, General Washington,
I got a duty to do that!&mdash;There's only jest one thing,
sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I'd sorta&mdash;er&mdash;kinda like my wife an' children protected
from the&mdash;wal'&mdash;the results o' my bein' an active
an' notorious Tory.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Ye see, I don't mind what folks think o' me, but Marthy&mdash;that's
my wife, sir&mdash;she an' the young un's
might git&mdash;wal'&mdash;treated pretty shabby.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I understand. I'll give you an order for them to use in
case of necessity.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Would ye&mdash;er&mdash;sign it yerself, General?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Certainly! Here&mdash;I'll write it now. (<i>rattle of paper</i>)
Let's see&mdash;(<i>slowly</i>) "To the Good People of New Jersey
and all others it may concern: It is ordered that the
wife and children of John Honeyman of&mdash;" Where's
your home?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Grigstown, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>"&mdash;of Grigstown, the notorious Tory now within the
British lines and probably acting the part of a British spy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
should be protected from all harm and annoyances. This
is no protection to Honeyman himself." Is that satisfactory?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I cal'ate that covers it, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Very well, I'll sign it&mdash;(<i>signing</i>) There you are, sir.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I'm much obleeged to ye, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>No, Honeyman, I'm the one who is your debtor. Good
day, sir.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Good day, General Washington. Next time ye see me I'll
be yer prisoner.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And John Honeyman left Washington's camp to set
about making his position secure with the British. He
became one of the regular meat contractors for Cornwallis's
army, which pursued Washington across the state
of New Jersey during the next month.</p>

<p>Washington did not hurry his retreat, but he always got
away. Finally about the first of December, he came to
Trenton, where he halted for a week and sent men up
and down the river to collect all the boats on the Delaware.
He knew that he would be forced to retreat into
Pennsylvania; and he proposed to leave no means for the
enemy to follow him. On December 8, 1776, the British
advance, which consisted of a brigade of Hessians under
Colonel Rall, entered Trenton; but as usual, Washington
was half a day ahead of his pursuers, and as the Hessians
entered the village, the rear guard of the Americans was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
just entering the last of the boats, and safely pulled away
to the Pennsylvania shore! Lord Howe, who had joined
Cornwallis, sent out men to look for boats, but none could
be found. The weather turned cold. Lord Howe was
uncomfortable; so he decided to put his troops into winter
quarters and let the pursuit go. He had done enough
for one season!</p>

<p>He and Cornwallis arranged to scatter the troops about
New Jersey to hold that territory, while they went back
to New York to enjoy the winter.</p>

<p>Trenton was left in charge of Colonel Rall and his brigade
of Hessians. On December 22, John Honeyman drove a
small herd of cattle into Trenton, left them standing in
front of headquarters, as he went up and knocked on the
door. (<i>knocks</i>)</p>

<p class="center">RALL (<i>off</i>)</p>

<p>Come in! Come in!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Mornin', Colonel Rall!</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Oh, it's you, Honeyman!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Aye, it's me&mdash;an' I got some cattle out front here fer
yer Quartermaster.</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Well, that's good news&mdash;my men will be glad to see that
beef! Now we can give 'em a Christmas dinner that'll
<i>be</i> a Christmas dinner!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>All ye need now, Colonel, is a mite o' wine, eh?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Never fear, we've got the wine!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal', ye kin have a fu'st-rate Christmas then.</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Yes sir! With roast beef and two hogsheads of fine wine&mdash;we
should do very well.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Two? Pshaw, is that all?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Why&mdash;what's the matter with that?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Two hogsheads won't go so far with a whole brigade.</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Oh, I haven't got a whole brigade.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Ye ain't?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>No, just a thousand men, that's all! Why sir, they can all
get roarin' drunk on the ration I'll issue 'em.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>An' like as not they will, eh, Colonel?</p>

<p class="center">RALL (<i>chuckling</i>)</p>

<p>Well, Honeyman, what do you expect o' soldiers? Christmas
you know&mdash;and out here in this God-forsaken
place. Let 'em get drunk, I say. There's nothing else
to do.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal', Colonel, I cal'ate 'tain't often ye find a better officer
than ye be! I'd like to serve under ye!</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Well, if you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir. I'd do it if I wasn't helpin' along things in my
way by roundin' up food fer the king's men. Wal',
mebbe ye better sign fer these critters out in front an' I'll
be gittin' along. I got to hike over to the next post. Er&mdash;by
the way&mdash;how fer is it to the next detachment o'
troops?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Oh, about six miles south.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Six miles, huh? How fer to the next one north?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Nobody north of us.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Eh, nobody north?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>No, I'm command of the flank. This is the last post.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I cal'ate that makes a lot o' hard work fer ye, Colonel?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Hard work?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Sure, don't ye have to patrol up an' down the river, an'
sich like things?</p>

<p class="center">RALL (<i>laughing</i>)</p>

<p>What for?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal', after all, there's <i>some</i> o' the enemy left, ain't there?</p>

<p class="center">RALL (<i>laughing</i>)</p>

<p>A half-a-dozen starved ragamuffins. What could they
do to my trained Hessians?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN (<i>joining in the laugh</i>)</p>

<p>Not much, I cal'ate! Ye ain't in much danger, an' that's
a fact!</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>If we had some boats we'd soon make short work of them.
But confound the rascals, they made away with all the
boats.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Ye ain't got no boats, eh?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Not a one!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Ye ain't built none, eh?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Why should we?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal'&mdash;if ye want to git across the river&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Oh, we'll get across as soon as the river freezes over. We'll
get the last o' the rebels then.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Wal', Colonel, good luck to ye. But I hope ye won't be
in too big a hurry to capture all the rebels!</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Eh, what's that?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Er&mdash;I'll be out of a job; and so'll ye be, Colonel!</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Yes, that's right too. Well, let's have a look at your cattle
and I'll sign for 'em.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Come on&mdash;you fu'st, sir.</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Thanks&mdash;hm&mdash;how many did you say there were?</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>There's twenty-two critters there&mdash;er, there was when
I drove 'em up.</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;they look a little scrawny.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Best I could git, Colonel!</p>

<p class="center">RALL (<i>counting</i>)</p>

<p>Two&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;seven&mdash;ten (<i>etc.</i>) Hm&mdash;twenty-one's
all I make, Honeyman.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Twenty-one? Pshaw now&mdash;did one o' them critters go
trapsin' off. (<i>he counts</i>) Yes sir, that's just what's happened.
Wall&mdash;sign fer the twenty-one, an' I'll go out
lookin' fer that other critter.</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Here you are&mdash;let me have that bill&mdash;(<i>rattle of paper</i>)
Twenty-one in good condition, signed&mdash;Rall. There you
are. Hope you find the other one.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Thankee&mdash;where's that road off to the left go?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>That&mdash;oh, that's the river road.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>I cal'ate the critter musta gone that way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Better keep a sharp lookout if you go down that way.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Eh? What fer?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Some o' those ragamuffin rebels might be on this side
of the river.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Pshaw now&mdash;ye don't say! They come across the river,
do they?</p>

<p class="center">RALL</p>

<p>Yes, once in a while. But they don't dare bother us. But
they might pick up a civilian.</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>Oh, I cal'ate I kin take keer o' myself. I got my whip
and this halter.</p>

<p class="center">RALL (<i>laughing</i>)</p>

<p>That ought to be enough to scare 'em away from you!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p>They'll figger I'm the hangman come out to git 'em&mdash;fetchin'
my halter along! (<i>he and</i> RALL <i>laugh</i>)</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Honeyman started down the river road, cracking his
whip and swinging his halter. A couple of miles down
the road, four Continental soldiers were in hiding. They
had been sent out with instructions to pick up a prisoner,
if possible, and bring him into Washington's headquarters
for the purpose of securing information. As Honeyman
drew near their place of hiding in the brush alongside the
river road, the men heard the snapping of his whip.
(<i>crack of whip</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL (<i>low</i>)</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>There, I see him! Huh, it's just a farmer crackin' his

<p class="center">SOLDIER</p>

<p>Yah, I see him. What's he got in his other hand?</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>Looks like a piece o' rope.</p>

<p class="center">SOLDIER</p>

<p>A halter! Look, Corporal!</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>Yep. A halter. Well, no use stoppin' him. Lie low. We

<p class="center">SOLDIER</p>

<p>No! Listen, Corporal, we got to capture him.</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center">SOLDIER</p>

<p>The General issued orders about him.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Protesting and struggling, Honeyman was thrown into
the boat and carried to the Pennsylvania shore of the Delaware.
In the meantime, on that very afternoon of December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
22, 1776, Washington was holding a council of
war with his staff.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Congress has fled
from Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>What? Fled? Left Philadelphia? Too bad! (<i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I'm sorry! I asked them particularly to stay there, as I
feared the effect on the people of the country. But it
seems that even Congress has lost faith in the army.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>General Washington.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>General Knox.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>We've got to do something to re-establish their faith!
(<i>all agree</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Yes! But what? Charles Lee is captured&mdash;his army
gone&mdash;we can't look for any help from that quarter.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Sir, can't we go back across the river, suddenly&mdash;and
strike a blow before the enemy knows what we are up to?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>We'll have to! It's our only hope. But how, when, and
where? I had hoped that we might get information that
would guide us in our plans. Well, we haven't got it!
Now, much as I hate to make any move without full and
complete information, I don't see what else we can do.
The river will be frozen over in a week or ten days. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
means that the enemy can cross over and chase us whither
they please! If we are to do anything, we've got to do
it now! I've called you here to lay this before you. Will
you follow me on a blind chance?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Yes! We will!
You can count on us, sir. (<i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I want you all to realize that this is a desperate chance.
Failure means&mdash;well, we might as well face it&mdash;it
means the end of our cause; but success&mdash;well, gentlemen,
we can only hope and pray for success! (<i>knock</i>)
Will you see who's at the door, Colonel Reed?</p>

<p class="center">REED</p>

<p>Ragamuffins? Yes, they are, poor fellows, but Honeyman,
we'll see&mdash;perhaps ragamuffins can fight when
they're given the chance&mdash;and with this information,
you have given us our chance!</p>

<p class="center">HONEYMAN</p>

<p>No, General, I figger ye'd better treat me like a prisoner

<p>That night, by some unexplained accident, John Honeyman
escaped from the guardhouse and returned to the
British lines, where he continued his valuable service for
the American cause.</p>

<p>Washington, with the information that Honeyman had
brought him, was able to lay his plans intelligently and
carefully.</p>

<p>Just after dusk has fallen on Christmas night, Washington
orders his troops to the shore of the river. Snow is
falling and the wind is howling, as Washington and Knox
stand together near the boat landing&mdash;(<i>wind and murmur
of crowd with occasional sharp commands in background
through this scene.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>This weather ought to help us, Knox.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Brrr&mdash;it's cold enough to keep the Hessians indoors&mdash;if
that's what you mean, General.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>The snow will cover our movements.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;in more ways than one, General.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE (<i>off</i>)</p>

<p>First brigade is formed, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Very good. (<i>lower</i>) Order embarkation to begin, Knox.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Artillery first, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>No, a company of foot soldiers first to stand guard and
protect the landing.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Yes, sir. (<i>calling</i>) General Green!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE (<i>off</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Send one of your companies across first to stand guard
and protect the landing.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Very good, sir. Company A, into the boats! (<i>orders and
mob confusion</i>)</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>The river looks bad, sir. See all the ice? It looks wicked!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Ice! Hm&mdash;I hadn't foreseen this.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE (<i>calling</i>)</p>

<p>General Knox!</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>The boatmen say they can't make it, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Can't make it? But they've got to!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Sorry sir, they say the floating ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Call Colonel Glover, Knox!</p>

<p class="center">KNOX (<i>calling</i>)</p>

<p>Glover! Colonel Glover! Pass the word for Colonel
Glover. (<i>order repeated several times at different distances</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>We've got to get across, Knox, we've got to! If this attempt
fails, there's nothing left for us! Nothing!</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>We'll get across, sir, if we have to swim.</p>

<p class="center">GLOVER (<i>coming in</i>)</p>

<p>Colonel Glover reports, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Colonel Glover, can your regiment of seafaring men
handle our boats in that river?</p>

<p class="center">GLOVER</p>

<p>General Washington, my men can handle boats in any
water!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>The boatmen say they can't cross because of the floating
ice.</p>

<p class="center">GLOVER</p>

<p>Sir, my men are <i>sea</i> sailors, not river boatmen&mdash;it takes
more than ice to scare them off!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good! Put some of them in every boat.</p>

<p class="center">GLOVER</p>

<p>Yes, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>And you will take general charge of the entire fleet.</p>

<p class="center">GLOVER</p>

<p>Very good, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Tell them to listen to General Knox's commands. He is
the only one whose voice can be heard in this storm!</p>

<p class="center">GLOVER</p>

<p>Very good, sir! (<i>going out</i>) This way, the Marblehead
regiment! This way to the boats! (<i>mob</i>)</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>For the next nine hours the difficult work of crossing the
ice-filled river went forward. Colonel Glover and his
regiment of seafaring men from Marblehead, Massachusetts,
performed almost miraculous service in landing
every man, horse, and gun without losing anything!</p>

<p>It was five o'clock in the morning of December 26 when
Washington, now on the Jersey shore of the river, turned
to Knox&mdash;(<i>wind and crowd noise</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Has the last boatload landed, Knox?</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Call the men to attention.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX (<i>calling</i>)</p>

<p>Call your men to attention!</p>

<p class="center">VOICES</p>

<p>Company&mdash;company! (<i>etc.</i>)
Attention! First regiment is formed, sir, second&mdash;(<i>etc.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>The men are formed, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Men, we are about to start upon our most important offensive.
Upon the results of our efforts this morning depends
the outcome of our struggle for liberty and independence.</p>

<p>I shall take the first brigade and half the artillery with me
down the Pennington road. The rest of the detachment
under command of General Green will take the river road.
It should take us about four hours to reach the outposts of
Trenton. Now, it is necessary for us to attack simultaneously,
so will the officers all set their watches with mine.
It is now just five o'clock and ten minutes. At nine
o'clock, attack!</p>

<p>Let every man march quietly, keep in good order in the
ranks, give prompt obedience to his officers, and bear in
mind the watchword&mdash;<i>Victory or Death!</i> March your
men off!</p>

<p>First Regiment&mdash;Second Regiment&mdash;Company&mdash;Company&mdash;(<i>etc.</i>)</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Thus, on that cold and stormy December morning, the
half frozen, desperate band of ragamuffin soldiers started
its march toward Trenton&mdash;toward its last forlorn hope.
Washington prayed that he might catch the garrison of
Hessians unsuspecting and unprepared; but he feared that
he had taken so long to effect the crossing of the ice-filled
river that he could not surprise the enemy!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, warning was sent to Colonel Rall, but
that officer, secure in his belief that no effective force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Colonial soldiers could be sent against him, paid no attention
to the warning.</p>

<p>It was nearly nine o'clock when the Corporal of the advance
guard of Washington's detachment hurried back to
report to the General.</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>General Washington, we've sighted the enemy outpost.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good! Halt the brigade, Knox.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Brigade!</p>

<p class="center">VOICES</p>

<p>Company&mdash;company! (<i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Halt!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>It lacks five minutes of the time set! Oh, Corporal&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>Yes, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Did you see any sign of General Green's command on the
river road?</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>We saw 'em a half hour ago, sir, as we came over that hill
back there.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Were they abreast of us?</p>

<p class="center">CORPORAL</p>

<p>Yes, sir, a little ahead of us, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good. General Knox.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>This storm has likely ruined the flintlocks.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>No doubt of that, sir&mdash;we'll have to use bayonets.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Order bayonets fixed, and the troops deployed ready to
charge bayonets on command.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Brigade, fix bayonets! (<i>voices repeat order, etc.</i>)
Shall the artillery lead or follow, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Follow and take position at the head of every street.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Very good, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;two minutes&mdash;order the troops deployed.</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Deploy your troops&mdash;prepare to charge bayonets! (<i>command
repeated&mdash;mob noise as order is obeyed</i>)</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Keep your ears open for firing&mdash;it's nearly time. (<i>musketry</i>)</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>There it is, sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Green has started! Order the charge, Knox! And God be
with us!</p>

<p class="center">KNOX</p>

<p>Forward! Charge bayonets! Ho! (<i>a great roar from
the mob as the charge begins</i>)</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Washington and his men swept into the village of Trenton,
catching the Hessians totally unprepared! In an hour
and a half it was all over. The disposed army of ragamuffins
put the Hessians to rout! It was the first great
American victory of the Revolution, and its effect was
enormous. The discouraged Colonists suddenly received
new heart. Hope for the cause of independence had a rebirth,
and Washington, instead of fighting a losing battle
alone, found himself the leader of his countrymen in fact,
as well as in name! In crossing the Delaware, Washington
had saved the cause of American independence!</p>
